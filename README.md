## Status effect timer

Use double click on the token hud status icons to select the duration of the effect.
Currently only works in combat, and only has 3 options: 1 round (it is effectively 2, since most of the effects like this mention "Works until the end of creature's next turn"), 10 rounds, and 100 rounds. Written for dnd 5e.
